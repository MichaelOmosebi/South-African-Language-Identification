# South-African-Language-Identification
### A classification challenge aimed at recognizing which of the eleven south African languages a text is written in

South Africa is a multicultural society that is characterised by its rich linguistic diversity. Language is an indispensable tool that can be used to deepen democracy and also contribute to the social, cultural, intellectual, economic and political life of the South African society.

The country is multilingual with 11 official languages, each of which is guaranteed equal status. Most South Africans are multilingual and able to speak at least two or more of the official languages.

The dataset used for this challenge is the NCHLT Text Corpora collected by the South African Department of Arts and Culture & Centre for Text Technology (CTexT, North-West University, South Africa). The training set was improved through additional cleaning done by Praekelt.

The data is in the form Language ID, Text. The text is in various states of cleanliness. Some NLP techniques will be necessary to clean up the data.
